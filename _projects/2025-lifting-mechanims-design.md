This project is a class project for ENGRD 2020 - Statics and Mechanics of Solids. 

It involved designing a 2D lifting mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm design space using one rigid bar (fixed length of your choice), three pin supports (two fixed to the ground), and a linear actuator selected from an online catalog (using its maximum rated force). The goal is to configure these components into a rigid, pin-jointed frame that can lift the maximum possible load to the greatest possible height. All members and joints are idealized as rigid and frictionless. The design challenge lies in optimizing the geometry—bar length, support placement, and actuator positioning—to maximize lifting performance while staying within the space and force constraints.

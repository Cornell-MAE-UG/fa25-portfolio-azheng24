This project is a class project for ENGRD 2210 – Thermodynamics.

It involves selecting a real-world thermodynamic device or system covered in the course—such as a heat exchanger, pump, refrigerator, engine, or turbine—and explaining in detail how it operates using system diagrams, photos or schematics, and the appropriate mass, energy, and entropy balance equations. The core objective is to demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying thermodynamic principles and then analyze how a specific design or operating change (such as altered flow rates, modified temperatures, or a different configuration) would affect system performance.

I chose to analyze a heat exchanger. 

**Setup:**  
This is an example of the heat exchanger in parallel flow.

**Results:**  
---  
Parallel Flow Temperatures: 

Initial cold: 7.3°C  
Initial hot: 39.5°C  

Final cold: 18.7°C  
Final hot: 22.3°C  

∆T for cold: 11.4°C  
∆T for hot: -17.2°C  


Counter Flow Temperatures:

Initial cold: 5.3°C  
Initial hot: 39.9°C  

Final cold: 22.2°C  
Final hot: 18.2°C  

∆T for cold: 16.9°C  
∆T for hot: -21.7°C  

Based on this data, we can conclude that counterflow heat exchangers are generally considered better than parallel flow heat exchangers for heat transfer. 

In a counterflow heat exchanger, the two fluids flow in opposite directions. This allows for a more consistent temperature difference between the fluids along the length of the exchanger, which promotes better heat transfer. In contrast, in a parallel flow heat exchanger, the fluids flow in the same direction, and the temperature difference decreases along the length of the exchanger, reducing the heat transfer efficiency.
